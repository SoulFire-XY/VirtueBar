VirtueBar is a simple, East-to-learn, high level programming language developed by a single person in python and bare code from scratch. It is in development and many features are yet to be added. Hope you have a great type using my programming langauge.

Keywords:
- VAL - variable
    -> Used to declare a Variable. Cannot be used Successively. Constants can be changed into variables.
    Implementation:
		VAL a = 1
		1 + VAL a = 3
		VAL a = 2 + 1

- CONST - Constant
	-> Used to declare a Constant. Cannot be used Successively. Cannot change 	variable to constant.
    Implementation:
		VAL a = 1
		1 + VAL a = 3
		VAL a = 2 + 1

- WITH - and operator
    -> Same as 'and' in other languages. Used in condition checking and state/boolean verification. Can be used multiple times.
    Imprementation:
		5 == 5 AND 3 != 4
		IF 2 + 2 == 4 AND 1 + 3 == 4 ACT 1

- OR - or operator
	-> The 'or' operator, same as in other languages. Used in condition checking and state/boolean verification. Can be used multiple times.
    Imprementation:
		5 == 5 OR 3 != 4
		IF 2 + 2 == 4 OR 1 + 3 == 4 ACT 1

- INVER - not operator
	-> Same as 'not' in other languages. Used to invert variables and boolean. Can be used multiple times.
	Implementation:
		!1 and !0

Combination Keywords:
	IF and ELIF Statements:
		- IF - If statement
		- ACT - Do if statement
		- ELIF - Else If statement
		- OTHER - Else statement

	Loop Statements:
		- FOR - For Loop statement
		- WHILE - While Loop statement
		- TO - In FOR Loop statement
		- STEP - Amount of Value to skip while iterating
